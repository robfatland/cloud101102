# Google Cloud Platform

# 101 Basics

The console is found at [https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com). 

Training materials begin at [cloud.google.com/training](https://cloud.google.com/training/).

From there follow through to [(free) intro labs](https://cloud.google.com/training/free-labs/).
You'll want to keep an eye out for **Qwiklabs**: These run in the browser, create the resources you 
need for you on the Google Cloud, and walk you through the subject step by step. They're nifty; 
but to use them you will need to create an account: Use your working email but create a password
that is not your UW NetID password. This will activate the **Start** button on the Qwiklabs.
Once you start a Qwiklab you will click on **Open Console**. The Console is your browser based
access port to the GCP. 


# 102 Machine Learning 

We'll jump right into using **colab**, a Jupyter-notebook-like hosted environment for sandboxing and 
learning about machine learning on the Google cloud.
