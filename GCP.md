# Google Cloud Platform

# 101 Basics

The console is found at [https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com). 

Training materials begin at [cloud.google.com/training](https://cloud.google.com/training/).

From there follow through to [(free) intro labs](https://cloud.google.com/training/free-labs/).
You'll want to keep an eye out for **Qwiklabs**: These run in the browser, create the resources you 
need for you on the Google Cloud, and walk you through the subject step by step. They're nifty; 
but to use them you will need to create an account: Use your working email but create a password
that is not your UW NetID password. This will activate the **Start** button on the Qwiklabs.
Once you start a Qwiklab you will click on **Open Console**. The Console is your browser based
access port to the GCP. Back on the labs page: When finished be sure to click on the **End Lab**
button at the top to get credit for completing the lab. 


> Pro tip: On GCP the first resource organizing concept is the **project**. A project is something like 
a logical wrapper around a set of cloud resources. It can have multiple Users associated for the purpose
of working collaboratively. 

GCP **Services** are organized in seven categories: 

* Compute: Houses a variety of machine types that support any type of workload. The different computing options let you decide how involved you want to be with operational details and infrastructure amongst other things.
* Storage: data storage and database options for structured or unstructured, relational or non relational data.
* Networking: services that balance application traffic and provision security rules amongst other things.
* Stackdriver: a suite of cross-cloud logging, monitoring, trace, and other service reliability tools.
* Tools: services for developers managing deployments and application build pipelines.
* Big Data: services that allow you to process and analyze large datasets.
* Artificial Intelligence: a suite of APIs that run specific artificial intelligence and machine learning tasks on the Google Cloud platform.



# 102 Machine Learning 

We'll jump right into using **colab**, a Jupyter-notebook-like hosted environment for sandboxing and 
learning about machine learning on the Google cloud.
